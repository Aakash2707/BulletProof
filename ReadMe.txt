1)How they have designed the game?

The Game has been designed by using highly optimised softwares such as Unity and Aseprite.
Game Mechanics used to achieve the target includes :
	->Shooting System
	->Spawning 
	->Swipe detectiobn 
	->Probability 
	->Checkpoints 
	->Different Managers used to manage the different components of the game.
	
	
-All these system together interact for optimised game experience.
-Swipe detection is used for player movement in horizontal plane while we get input from the mobile touch.
-Spwaning is used in multiple scenario which includes meteor spawning ability spawning.
-Checkpoints are used for determining game pace that affects the probability to make game more difficulty 
-All the scripts are opimised and generic in nature so that it can be reused for multiple components of game to increase performance for mobile users. 
-Multiple Flowcharts and Algorithms where discussed and handwritten for game implementations.
-Managers used for managing swipes, spawning(both meteors and powerups),etc.
-> 2D Sprites : Aseprite : All the assests where 2D Sprite based keeping in mind of the screen aspect ratio and quailty.


2) What Architecture they have used. How they created the art, from where did they source the art assets. Who created the art?

Architecture - 
	Unity 2D (2020.3.33f), 
	C# Scripting, 
	Aseprite (Pixel Art), 
	Trello Workspace. 
The entire art was created from scratch using the software, Aseprite. Our Game Artists are - Aakash Gupta and Anshul Tomar.

Player-Controlled Spaceship - The player's spaceship is the main character in the game. It can move left and right, fire weapons and collect power-ups. 
*Meteors - Players need to protect the spaceship from the meteors while smashing them to gain points. 
*Power-ups - Collecting power-ups enhances player abilities, like the multi-laser shot that gives the ability to fire multiple shots at once. Protection Shield provides protection to the spaceship from meteor damage for certain amount of time. Lastly, Spread Laser gives the spaceship the ability to fire 4 multiple shots at single time which spreads out, allowing it to kill more meteors at once. 
*Scoring system: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as they destroy and dodge meteors.
*Sound effects and music: The game features sound effects and background music to enhance the gameplayÂ experience which also helps in keeping the interest of the player 


3) What is the future scope of the game? Can you see it becoming a multiplayer game? If yes, how?
SPACE SHOOTER is a game which targets the audience who have interests in high paced games as it changes pace with time. in future we look forward to enhance and optimize the game more
*yes the game can be modified in various ways. 
adding the concept of multiplayer in a 2D space shooter game is challenging but can be done by adding multiple scenes and giving the meteor control to the opponent 
this ensures that both the players are equally indulged in the game
th CO-OP version of the game can also include various different powerups like the meteor shooting and the size increases everytime the main player is destroyed
